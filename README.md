## DESCRIPTION:  
This 'Learn How to Solder Badge' is inspired by the Letterman patches found on high school jackets, to keep in theme with the DEF CON 30 "Homecoming" theme this year.  It is a DIY kit and does not come assembled.  You will require a soldering iron, solder, and flush cutters to assemble this kit.  A YouTube demonstration will be available for follow-along and I highly encourage you to watch the video BEFORE assembling.

This electronics kit is a great project for those people who want to learn how to solder or already know how to solder!

The kit features a circuit board, components, and a lanyard so you can wear it around your neck when finished :)

The circuit is known as an "Astable Multivibrator," which means that the top two LEDs will alternate flashing on and off. The lower left LED will turn on when the button is pressed. The lower right LED turns on when the power is on.

The two SAO ports are meant for low-power SAOs only.  Since the badge is powered by CR2032 batteries, they're not capable of outputting a lot of current.  SAOs with a few LEDs should be fine.  Please note that if SAO ports are used, the amount of current that is drawn may affect the flash-rate of the top two LEDs on the badge.  See YouTube video for reference.  Also, the power for the two SAO ports is independent of the power switch.  I have found that applying a fix to the board seems to yield better performance on the SAOs.  A wire and knife are needed to apply the fix and is referenced in the YouTube video.

Kit Includes:  
Circuit Board, Lanyard, LEDs (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green), Transistors, Capacitors, Resistors, Voltage Regulator, SAO Connectors, SAO Kit, Diode, Switch, Button, Battery Holders, Batteries, DEF CON 30 Homecoming Stickers
