## DESCRIPTION:  
The L33T Badge electrifies your Official DEF CON 31 Badge! The Official DEF CON 31 Badge is not going to be electronic this year (2023). Although we don't know what it looks like yet, DEF CON announced there will be a "chamber" in the badge in which you can insert... anything you want. The L33T Badge slides into that chamber (see reference pictures).  Stickers and Googly Eyes are also included :) The orange "badge simulator" you see in the photos is for reference only and is not included.

This Badge is a Learn-How-to-Solder kit and features four LED 16-segment displays which you can customize and configure to display a word, numbers, leet speak, etc (up to four characters).  The four static characters are configured with solder pads on the back of the badge and can be reconfigured by changing which pads are soldered. It also features three eye-catching color-changing LEDs.  

The L33T badge is powered by a single AA battery, and three are included with your purchase! One battery should last you around 10-12 hours, so the three batteries should last you Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at DEF CON!

The mini lanyard that comes with the badge is meant to help stabilize and secure the L33T Badge to the Official DEF CON 31 Badge. Insert the lanyard through the circuit board and secure it to your badge or main lanyard. This provides safety in case the board were to separate from the badge.

Kit Includes:  
Circuit Board, 16 Segment LED Displays, Mini Lanyard, Color Changing LEDs, 100uF Capacitor, 68 Ohm and 100 Ohm Resistors, Boost Converter, Switch, Battery Holder, AA Batteries, Stickers, Googly Eyes
